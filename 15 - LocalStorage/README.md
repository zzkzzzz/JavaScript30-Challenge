# LocalStorage

## NOTES
### JS
  - localStorage
    -  The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.
    - `localStorage.setItem("key", "value");`
    - `localStorage.getItem("key");`
    - `localStorage.removeItem("key");`
    -  key and value can only be string 
  - `e.preventDefault()`
    - The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur.
### HTML
  - `<form>`
    - The HTML <form> element defines a form that is used to collect user input
    - `<input type="text">`	Defines a single-line text input field
    - `<input type="radio">`	Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
    - `<input type="submit">`	Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)
    
### CSS
