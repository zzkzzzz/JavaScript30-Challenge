# Sticky Nav
[demo](https://zzkzzzz.github.io/JavaScript30-Challenge/24%20-%20Sticky%20Nav/index.html)

## NOTES
### JS
  - `offsetTop`
  - `offsetHeight`

### CSS

  - `position: fixed;`
    - element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled
  - `position: sticky` 
    - element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
    - seems can achieve the same effect in this project by using this
